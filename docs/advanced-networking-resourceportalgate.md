# ResourcePortal Networking — LAN Attachments and Device VPN

## Private tenant Networks

Applications within the same tenant connect through explicitly authorized Docker Swarm overlay Networks. Application Network membership does not automatically grant access to customer LANs.

## LAN Attachments

LAN Attachment gives a **single RP-hosted application** a dedicated layer-2 identity in a remote customer's existing Ethernet LAN through RP Gate. The application remains hosted in ResourcePortal and obtains its own stable locally-administered MAC and an IPv4 address from the customer's **existing DHCP** server.

The path is:

```text
RP application namespace (GRETAP + DHCP)
  → RP tenant overlay
  → RP Gate gateway bridge (per application)
  → encrypted WireGuard /30 + GRETAP
  → customer's RP Gate isolated bridge
  → dedicated unnumbered Ethernet/VLAN
  → customer switch and existing DHCP server
```

No customer LAN routes, BGP advertisements, transit NAT, or site-wide routing are installed by this feature. The customer-facing Gate port must be a **dedicated, unnumbered wired Ethernet interface or isolated VLAN**. Never bridge the management interface, a Wi-Fi station client, or another application's pre-existing bridge. One application per authorized attachment; cross-tenant ownership, duplicate replicas, stale peer handshake, bridge and MAC ownership, and DHCP subnet are validated before granting the connection.

### Workflow

1. Create the application's tenant Network and deploy its App Group so it is attached to the Swarm overlay.
2. Create and enroll an RP Gate using its one-time Linux installer. A certified Gate agent must report `gate-l2-v1`.
3. Under tenant Networking → LAN Attachments, choose the application, its Network, the Gate, the dedicated LAN interface, and the expected DHCP subnet.
4. The reconciler transitions an eligible record from `Pending` to `Provisioning`. Neither state proves that DHCP worked. The RP node agent creates only the application's owned GRETAP link. The Gate accepts only a recent authenticated WireGuard peer and the expected tenant/application policy.
5. The DHCP hook accepts only leases from the approved subnet and does **not** change the application's Docker default route or resolv.conf.
6. Once independently verified, the attachment may become `Active`. Revocation must dismantle both ends of the encrypted L2 channel and preserve a durable cleanup record until the kernel confirms removal.

Disconnection, stale peer handshakes, unauthorized MACs, revoked grants, changed Docker task identities, and unavailable control planes must fail closed. A no-op status or a synthetic DHCP lease is never enough to mark an attachment healthy.

### Rollout and rollback requirements

The DB migration removes legacy routed-site resource records. Historical migrations are immutable so older installations and recovery snapshots remain reproducible. **Do not ship or auto-apply** this destructive schema change before a verified real database restore, image-level rollback, release manifest safety gates, and real Swarm DHCP/ARP/traffic/revocation integration tests. A failed cleanup must not claim completion. Device VPN is not deleted by this change.

### Real L2 verification

Run `scripts/run-remote-lan-l2-dhcp-smoke.sh` only in an isolated Linux test runner with root/sudo permissions, WireGuard, GRETAP, dnsmasq, iproute2 and BusyBox. The test provisions four network namespaces, obtains a real customer-side DHCP lease and tests ARP, connectivity, and revocation. It must be executed in release CI rather than inferred from tests that validate only command generation.

## Device VPN

Device VPN is distinct: each user device obtains its own WireGuard configuration with a unique /32 address. Only its selected RP tenant Network prefixes are authorized; it does not attach a customer's entire LAN and never inherits access from LAN Attachment. Keep Device VPN's existing enrollment, audit, isolation and revocation behavior unchanged.
